        <h1>Automation for Client's Linux Box Fleet</h1>
        <p>At our client's organization, they manage an extensive network of Linux Boxes spread across their worldwide retail customer base. With a fleet of over 20,000 units, each store is equipped with one Linux Box, five DECT base units, and an average of 50 headsets. Our primary objective was to significantly reduce the amount of manual testing required, thereby boosting efficiency and reliability in their systems.</p>

        <h2>12-Month QA Strategy</h2>
        <p>Our proposed QA strategy involved a meticulous evaluation of the existing systems and processes. We recommended a balanced approach between manual and automated testing, with a progressive shift towards automation. We also established a robust process to manage firmware changes from the base unit manufacturer and outlined the approach to automation in three stages: short-term, medium-term, and long-term.</p>

        <h2>Integration Test Suite</h2>
        <p>To automate the integration testing of identified key systems, we designed a basic integration test suite. The suite included a detailed architectural design and specified the technologies used for implementation. Additionally, we outlined methods of running it and created a training plan to enable a less technical colleague to adapt and extend it.</p>

As a result, we were able to ensure the highest quality standards, resulting in an elevated customer experience, increased reliability, and the optimized performance of their Linux Box fleet.</p>
