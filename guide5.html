      <h1>The QA Culture—Everyone's Cup of Tea</h1>
    </section>

    <section id="content">
      <p>Think of QA like a cup of tea. It's a blend of different elements—tea leaves, water, milk, sugar—that come together to make a perfect brew. Similarly, QA isn't just the job of testers—it's everyone's responsibility.</p>

      <h2>Developers</h2>
      <p>The developers are the tea leaves. They're the base of everything. But they need to keep QA in mind during every stage of the development process, ensuring their code not only works, but works well.</p>

      <h2>Testers</h2>
      <p>The testers are the water that extracts the best out of the tea leaves. They test each component, making sure everything is running smoothly. But their job isn't just to find bugs—it's to advocate for quality at all times.</p>

      <h2>Users</h2>
      <p>The users are the milk and sugar. They make the tea complete. Their feedback is crucial in the QA process, helping identify any potential oversights and validate the overall user experience.</p>

      <p>QA is about creating a culture of quality, where everyone plays their part. It's about everyone being a quality advocate, ensuring the software not only works but exceeds expectations. And when everyone takes a sip of the QA culture, the result is a software that's everyone's cup of tea.</p>
