      <h1>The Pillars of Quality Assurance</h1>
    </section>

    <section id="content">
      <p>Quality Assurance (QA) stands on three crucial pillars: Testing, Requirement Verification, and Audits. Each of these pillars plays a vital role in ensuring that your application not only meets the requirements but also provides a seamless user experience.</p>

      <h2>Testing: The Test Drive for Your Software</h2>
      
      <p>Testing is the process of checking every feature in your application, one by one. It's like a test drive for your software, ensuring every part works as it should. Through rigorous testing, we can detect and rectify any issues before they reach the end-user.</p>

      <h2>Requirement Verification: The Checklist for Your Software</h2>

      <p>Requirement Verification ensures that the application meets all the specified requirements. Imagine you're baking a cake, and you forget the eggsâ€”you've missed a key ingredient, haven't you? Requirement verification is like ensuring your 'software cake' has all the ingredients it needs to be complete and function effectively.</p>

      <h2>Audits: The Quality Assurance of Your Development Process</h2>

      <p>Audits involve checking the development process to ensure it follows best practices. It's like an MOT test for your software-making machine. Audits ensure your process is robust, effective, and aligned with industry standards, enabling you to produce high-quality software consistently.</p>
